            <p class="secAdv">KEY FEATURES OF JAVA </p>
            <p class="sub-secAdv">Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.Principles
There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:[17]

It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
It must be robust and secure.
It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
It must execute with high performance.
It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.Java JVM and bytecode
Main articles: Java (software platform) and Java virtual machine
One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware.Performance

            <p class="sub-secAdv">C, as in the letter (c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code </P>

            <p class="secAdv">KEY FEATURES OF C++ </p>
            <p class="sub-secAdv">C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20).[12] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. </P>

            <p class="sectionTag">SOMETHING ABOUT ETHICAL HACKING AND HACKING</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">With the increased popularity of the Internet and e-Commerce, malicious hacking became the most commonly known form, an impression reinforced by its depiction in various forms of news media and entertainment. As a rule, the primary motive
                of malicious/unethical hacking involves stealing valuable information or financial gain. That said, not all hacking is bad. This brings us to the second type of hacking: Ethical hacking. So what is ethical hacking, and why do we need it?
                In this article, you will learn about several topics: What is Ethical Hacking? Type of Hackers White Hat vs Black Hat Hacker Roles and Responsibilities of an Ethical Hacker Benefits of Ethical Hacking Skills Required to Become an Ethical
                Hacker What is Ethical Hacking? Ethical Hacking is an authorized practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers
                to perform such activities in order to test the system’s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points
                that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the system/network/applications. By doing so, they can improve the security footprint so that it can
                better withstand attacks or divert them. Ethical hackers are hired by organizations to look into the vulnerabilities of their systems and networks and develop solutions to prevent data breaches. Consider it a high-tech permutation of the
                old saying “It takes a thief to catch a thief.” They check for key vulnerabilities include but are not limited to: Injection attacks Changes in security settings Exposure of sensitive data Breach in authentication protocols Components
                used in the system or network that may be used as access points Now, as you have the idea of what is ethical hacking, it's time to learn the type of hackers. Type of Hackers The practice of ethical hacking is called “White Hat” hacking,
                and those who perform it are called White Hat hackers. In contrast to Ethical Hacking, “Black Hat” hacking describes practices involving security violations. The Black Hat hackers use illegal techniques to compromise the system or destroy
                information. Unlike White Hat hackers, “Grey Hat” hackers don’t ask for permission before getting into your system. But Grey Hats are also different from Black Hats because they don’t perform hacking for any personal or third-party benefit.
                These hackers do not have any malicious intention and hack systems for fun or various other reasons, usually informing the owner about any threats they find. Grey Hat and Black Hat hacking are both illegal as they both constitute an unauthorized
                system breach, even though the intentions of both types of hackers differ. White Hat vs Black Hat Hacker The best way to differentiate between White Hat and Black Hat hackers is by taking a look at their motives. Black Hat hackers are
                motivated by malicious intent, manifested by personal gains, profit, or harassment; whereas White Hat hackers seek out and remedy vulnerabilities, so as to prevent Black Hats from taking advantage. The other ways to draw a distinction
                between White Hat and Black Hat hackers include: Techniques Used White Hat hackers duplicate the techniques and methods followed by malicious hackers in order to find out the system discrepancies, replicating all the latter’s steps to
                find out how a system attack occurred or may occur. If they find a weak point in the system or network, they report it immediately and fix the flaw. Legality Even though White Hat hacking follows the same techniques and methods as Black
                Hat hacking, only one is legally acceptable. Black Hat hackers break the law by penetrating systems without consent. Ownership White Hat hackers are employed by organizations to penetrate their systems and detect security issues. Black
                hat hackers neither own the system nor work for someone who owns it. After understanding what is ethical hacking, the types of ethical hackers, and knowing the difference between white-hat and black-hat hackers, let's have a look at the
                ethical hacker roles and responsibilities.Roles and Responsibilities of an Ethical Hacker Ethical Hackers must follow certain guidelines in order to perform hacking legally. A good hacker knows his or her responsibility and adheres to
                all of the ethical guidelines. Here are the most important rules of Ethical Hacking: An ethical hacker must seek authorization from the organization that owns the system. Hackers should obtain complete approval before performing any security
                assessment on the system or network. Determine the scope of their assessment and make known their plan to the organization. Report any security breaches and vulnerabilities found in the system or network. Keep their discoveries confidential.
                As their purpose is to secure the system or network, ethical hackers should agree to and respect their non-disclosure agreement. Erase all traces of the hack after checking the system for any vulnerability. It prevents malicious hackers
                from entering the system through the identified loopholes. Benefits of Ethical Hacking Learning ethical hacking involves studying the mindset and techniques of black hat hackers and testers to learn how to identify and correct vulnerabilities
                within networks. Studying ethical hacking can be applied by security pros across industries and in a multitude of sectors. This sphere includes network defender, risk management, and quality assurance tester. However, the most obvious
                benefit of learning ethical hacking is its potential to inform and improve and defend corporate networks. The primary threat to any organization's security is a hacker: learning, understanding, and implementing how hackers operate can
                help network defenders prioritize potential risks and learn how to remediate them best. Additionally, getting ethical hacking training or certifications can benefit those who are seeking a new role in the security realm or those wanting
                to demonstrate skills and quality to their organization. You understood what is ethical hacking, and the various roles and responsibilities of an ethical hacker, and you must be thinking about what skills you require to become an ethical
                hacker. So, let's have a look at some of the ethical hacker skills. Skills Required to Become an Ethical Hacker An ethical hacker should have in-depth knowledge about all the systems, networks, program codes, security measures, etc. to
                perform hacking efficiently. Some of these skills include: Knowledge of programming - It is required for security professionals working in the field of application security and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Scripting knowledge
                - This is required for professionals dealing with network-based attacks and host-based attacks. Networking skills - This skill is important because threats mostly originate from networks. You should know about all of the devices present
                in the network, how they are connected, and how to identify if they are compromised. Understanding of databases - Attacks are mostly targeted at databases. Knowledge of database management systems such as SQL will help you to effectively
                inspect operations carried out in databases. Knowledge of multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, etc. The ability to work with different hacking tools available in the market. Knowledge of search engines and servers. What Next?
                Ethical Hacking is a challenging area of study as it requires mastery of everything that makes up a system or network. This is why certifications have become popular among aspiring ethical hackers. This article has helped you understand
                what is ethical hacking, and the roles and responsibilities of an ethical hacker. Now, if you are planning to step into the world of cybersecurity, you can easily jump in with the relevant Ethical Hacking certifications, and you can advance
                your career in cybersecurity in the following ways: Certified individuals know how to design, build, and maintain a secure business environment. If you can demonstrate your knowledge in these areas, you will be invaluable when it comes
                to analyzing threats and devising effective solutions. Certified cybersecurity professionals have better salary prospects compared to their non-certified peers. According to Payscale, Certified Ethical Hackers earn an average salary of
                $90K in the U.S. Certification validates your skills in the field of IT security and makes you more noticeable while applying for challenging job roles. With the growing incidents of security breaches, organizations are investing hugely
